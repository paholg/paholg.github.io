Fill a pot with milk. Heat over medium until 185°F (85°C). Add acid (lemon juice if you want the flavor or vinegar for neutral) and stir. Stop stirring once curds have formed throughout the pot. | &bull; 1/2 gallon whole milk, not ultra-pasteurized <br> &bull; 2 Tbsp + 2 tsp (40ml) distilled white vinegar or fresh lemon juice
Without stirring, keep at temperature for 20 minutes. |
Line a fine-mesh strainer with paper towels or cheesecloth, and transfer curds in with a slotted spoon, straining until excess liquid is gone. |
Store for up to 2 days. For best results, use immediately. |
