title: Gluten "Ribs"
layout: recipe
---

Sauté onion in oil. | &bull; 1 large onion <br> &bull; 2/3 cup oil
Wash gluten. | &bull; 4 cups gluten flour
Put gluten in bowl and mix in ingredients. | &bull; 1/3 cup nutritional yeast <br> &bull; 1/2 cup peanut butter <br> &bull; 2 Tbsp paprika
Pour hot onions and oil onto the gluten and mix it in by hand. Continue until the gluten is in stringy, chunky piece. |
Break gluten into rib-sized pieces. Do not cut. |
Pour oil onto large cookie sheet and place the ribs on it. | &bull; 1/4-1/2 cup oil
Bake at 350-400° F (180-200° C) for 1 hour until crispy and brown on the bottom. They will puff up. |
Pour BBQ sauce over them and bake for 10 more minutes. The included recipe makes about half as much as needed. It's probably better to halve this recipe than double that one, though. |
