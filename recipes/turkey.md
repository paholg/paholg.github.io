Butterfly the turkey; use a pair of strong pountry shears to remove the spine - reserve for gravy. | &bull; 1 fresh turkey
Cut around the wishbone using a paring knife and remove it from the bird, and use the pountry shears to place a deep cut in the center of the breastbone from the back, so it's easier to crack. |
Flip the bird over, and press down between the breasts to flatten the turkey. Place on a large rimmed baking sheet. Combine the salt and baking powder in a medium bowl, whisking until well-incorporated. Liberally dust the bird with salt until it looks like it's been covered in a light snowfall. | &bull; 2 cups kosher salt <br> &bull; 1 Tbsp baking powder
Refrigerate, uncovered, overnight. |
Preheat oven to 400° F. |
Brush the salt off the turkey entirely and place on a wire rack. |
Line a rimmed backing sheet with the chopped vegetables and place the turkey and rack on top. | &bull; 6 cups chopped carrots, celery, and onions
Roast for 90-120 minutes, depending on the size of the turkey - breast should register 155° F, while thighs 175° F. |
Allow the turkey to rest for 30 minutes. |
