Note: This library is still unstable and undergoing breaking changes. It should mostly stabilize soon, but will likely depend on unstable Rust features for some time.


Dimensioned is a Rust library for compile-time type checking for arbitrary unit
systems. It is on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/dimensioned) and can be imported
with Cargo.

The page [Work with other types](work-with-others.html) illustrates its use; a more general
example will be added here later.
