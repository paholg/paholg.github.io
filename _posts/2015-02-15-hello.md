Hello, I am Paho and this is my blog.

I don't have much to say here right now, so I'll just leave you with a quotation:

> On two occasions I have been asked, "Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine
  wrong figures, will the right answers come out?" ... I am not able rightly to
  apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\- Charles Babbage
