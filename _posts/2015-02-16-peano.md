title: Peano Numbers

For various reasons, one might wish to have numbers embedded in a type system. One use
is a library that I am working on, [Dimensioned](/dimensioned/), which
you can read about by clicking the link and/or waiting for future blog entries.

Let's forget about that for now, and just assume that you care about having types that
contain numerical information for some reason. Rust has one such type built-in: the
array, which has type signature `[T; N]` where `T` is whatever type it is an array of
and `N` is the number of elements it contains. An array of length 3 and an array of
length 4 have distinct types. This is really nice, and while it would be nice to
construct custom types with similar embedded numbers, Rust does not currently and may
never support it.

So, we have to come up with our own method. By which, of course, I mean a method devised
long before computers existed.

In the late 1800s, a bunch of mathematicians decided that it was finally time to figure
out how to count.

```rust
struct Zero;
struct Succ<N>;
```

```rust
trait AddPeano<N> {
    type Output;
}

// Adding things to zero (e.g. 0 + 3)
impl<N> AddPeano<N> for Zero {
    type Output = N;
}

// Adding positive numbers (e.g. 1 + 2)
impl<M, N> AddPeano<N> for Succ<M> where N: AddPeano<M> {
        type Output = Succ<<N as AddPeano<M>>::Output>;
}
```
