Hello, my name is Paho Lurie-Gregg and I've decided to start a blog about some of my
 coding projects. I'm super into [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) these days (and it
 really is quite fantastic), so it will likely be my primary language here, other than
 English.

I don't have much else to say, so I'll just include my favorite programming-related
 quotation:

> On two occasions I have been asked, "Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine
  wrong figures, will the right answers come out?" ... I am not able rightly to
  apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\- Charles Babbage
