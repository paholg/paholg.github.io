Hello, my name is Paho Lurie-Gregg and I've decided to start a blog regarding some of my
 projects. I've pretty much fallen completely in love with
 [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) (and, really, there's little reason not to love it),
 so it will be my primary language here, other than English.

I don't have much else to say here, so I'll just include my favorite programming-related
 quotation:

> On two occasions I have been asked, "Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine
  wrong figures, will the right answers come out?" ... I am not able rightly to
  apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\- Charles Babbage
