Note: This library is still unstable and undergoing breaking changes. This will likely
continue for some kind, as it uses some features that have not hit Rust stable yet.

Dimensioned is a Rust library for compile-time type checking for arbitrary unit
systems. It is on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/dimensioned) and can be imported
with Cargo.

The page [Work with other types](with-others.md) illustrates its use; a more general
example will be added here later.
