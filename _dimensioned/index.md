Note: This library is still unstable and undergoing breaking changes. It should mostly
stabilize soon, but will likely depend on unstable Rust features for some time.


Dimensioned is a Rust library for compile-time type checking for arbitrary unit
systems.

The best place to find out more about it is the documentation linked to on the sidebar.

There are also some more in-depth tutorials, also on the sidebar. The code in the
examples is tested against each version of dimensioned with `rustdoc --test` and so
should remain up to date with the library.
